            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>World War I, also known as the Great War, began in 1914 after the assassination of Archduke Franz
                Ferdinand of Austria. His murder catapulted into a war across Europe that lasted until 1918. During the
                conflict, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire (the Central Powers) fought against
                Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Romania, Japan and the United States (the Allied Powers). Thanks
                to new military technologies and the horrors of trench warfare, World War I saw unprecedented levels of
                carnage and destruction. By the time the war was over and the Allied Powers claimed victory, more than
                16 million people—soldiers and civilians alike—were dead.</p>

            <h3>Fronts</h3>

            <p>According to an aggressive military strategy known as the Schlieffen Plan (named for its mastermind,
                German Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen), Germany began fighting World War I on two fronts, invading
                France through neutral Belgium in the west and confronting Russia in the east.</p>

            <p id="Fronts">Western front. On August 4, 1914, German troops crossed the border into Belgium. In the first
                battle of World War I, the Germans assaulted the heavily fortified city of Liege, using the most
                powerful weapons in their arsenal—enormous siege cannons—to capture the city by August 15. The Germans
                left death and destruction in their wake as they advanced through Belgium toward France, shooting
                civilians and executing a Belgian priest they had accused of inciting civilian resistance.</p>

            <h3>Letters</h3>
            <p>Many touching personal stories are vividly brought to life through letters exchanged during the First World War. The correspondence between Private William Martin and his fiancée Emily Chitticks reveals one of the most heart-breaking of all of these stories. Emily wrote this letter to Will before she had heard the devastating news that he had been killed in action. Read the letter in full below.<br>
                A letter from Emily Chitticks to her fiancé Private William Martin while serving with the 2/1st Royal Devon Yeomanry in Essex and Norfolk (August - March 1916) and with the 8th Battalion Devonshire Regiment (20th Brigade, 7th Division) in France (from January 1917 until his death on 27 March 1917).</p>

                <p>
                    'My Dearest Will, I feel I must write you again dear altho there is not much news to tell you. I wonder how you are getting on. I shall be so relieved to get a letter from you. I can't help feeling a bit anxious dear. I know how you must have felt darling when you did not get my letters for so long. Of course I know dear you will write as soon as ever you can, but the time seems so dull and weary without any news of you, if only this war was over dear and we were together again. It will be one day I suppose.
                    Don't think dear I am worrying unnecessarily about you, because I know God can take care of you wherever you are and if it's his will darling he will so are you to come back to me, that's how I feel about it dear, if we only put our trust in Him. I am sure he will. I wonder how your Cousins are getting on dear. We are feeling very anxious about George, as no news has come from him yet. We can't understand why his wife doesn't write.
                    How are your hands now dear? Mine are very sore, so chapped, and my left hand has got several chilblains on it and they do irritate. I could scratch it to bits. Have you been receiving the books I have sent you dear. I am very pleased to say dear I am keeping very well indeed, and I trust you are the same.
                    There has been a bit of a fuss over Arthur this week. He has been trying to get in the Army unbeknown to his parents, but Mrs T. thought his parents ought to be informed about it, so she wrote and told them about him and he had to go home in hot haste last night. I guess he got in a fine row, but he won't say today. He is as miserable as anything. Really Will I never saw such a boy as he is. I am afraid he is going to the bad. I don't know if Mrs T. will keep him on or not. He says he has to join up in a fortnight, but as he is under age I suppose his parents could stop him. I don't know whether they will or not. For my part I hope he does go, he will be a jolly good riddance for there is nothing but rows and deceitfulness going on where he is.
                    Well darling I don't know much more to say now, so will close with fondest love and kisses from your loving little girl. Emily.
                    P.S. Cheer up darling, and don't worry about me. I am quite alright, only anxious to get your letters. There is good news in the papers. Love from Mum and Dad.'
